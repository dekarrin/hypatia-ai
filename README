Rebecca's Exploration of Neural Networks
========================================

This is my messing around with neural networks in C. Nothing too fancy.

Requirements
------------
To run the system, you will need the build essentials for your platform.
Autotools is required, as is gcc (or compatible compiler).

In order to run testing, valgrind is required.

Compiling
---------
./configure
make

Testing
-------
./configure --CPPFLAGS="-DDEBUG" --CFLAGS="-g -O0"
make
make check
